                    <h2>🪐 Donald Trump Declares Himself ‘President of Mars’ After Spotting Own Face in Crater</h2>
                    <img src="images/Red Planet Day _ November 28 - The Fact Site.jpeg" alt="Donald Trump on Mars" class="mars">
                    <p>Mar-a-Lago, FL — July 7, 2025</p>
                    <p>President Donald J. Trump made headlines again today after holding an impromptu press conference at Mar-a-Lago, during which he claimed to have discovered his own face on the surface of Mars and promptly declared himself “President of Mars — the best planet, maybe ever.”</p>
                    <p>Wearing a red "Make Mars Great Again" hat and flanked by cardboard cutouts of himself in a spacesuit, Trump revealed a grainy, zoomed-in satellite image that appeared to show a vaguely face-shaped crater on the Martian surface.</p>
                    <p class="center">"If you look closely — very closely — you’ll see it. It’s me. That crater? It's Trump. Everyone's saying it. NASA called me. They said, ‘Sir, this might be the most presidential rock formation we've ever seen,’" Trump said, holding the image upside down for emphasis.</p>
                    <p>When asked if he had any scientific proof, Trump responded, “Science is a hoax. I know more about Mars than the Martians. I was once told I had a very Martian-like mind. Very advanced. Very red.”</p>
                    <h3>🚀 Trump’s Mars Agenda: Big Plans, Zero Rockets.</h3>
                    <p>Trump then outlined his ambitious new Martian policy platform, promising to build a "Space Wall" to keep out “illegal alien aliens,” develop luxury Mars resorts ("Trump Galaxy"), and rename the planet “Planet Trump.”</p>
                    <p>He also vowed to personally appoint himself President of Mars, citing "historic precedent" from "when I looked in a telescope and saw the future."</p>
                    <p>According to a document obtained from his campaign, Trump’s Mars administration will be headquartered in a replica of Mar-a-Lago built out of space dust and “patriotic optimism.” His planned cabinet includes Elon Musk’s Twitter account and a gold-plated Roomba named “Ivankabot.”</p>
                    <h3>🛰 NASA Responds: “We’re Not Involved”</h3>
                    <p>NASA quickly issued a statement distancing itself from Trump’s claims:</p>
                    <p>“We can confirm that no face resembling any human — let alone Donald Trump — has been observed on Mars. The crater in question is a naturally occurring geological formation, not a campaign poster,” said NASA Administrator Karen Lynch.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, SpaceX engineers reportedly locked down their Florida launchpads “just in case,” citing concerns that Trump may attempt to stow away inside a Falcon 9 disguised as a bucket of KFC.</p>
                    <h3>🤖 Twitter Reacts</h3>
                    <p>Social media erupted with reactions ranging from disbelief to amusement. Trending hashtags included #MartianMAGA, #TrumpOnMars, and #SpaceForceOne including a photoshopped image of Trump on a Martian throne made of gold golf clubs, and one viral post declaring, “Trump finally found intelligent life — it was himself.”</p>
                    <p>Despite pushback from scientists, reality, and Earth in general, Trump ended his press conference with a bold promise:</p>
                    <p>“Mars loves me. I have the highest approval ratings ever recorded by any red planet. Frankly, Earth has been very unfair to me. Mars gets it.”</p>
